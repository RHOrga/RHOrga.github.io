From the 4th to the 6th of December 2020 the seventh Robotic Hamburg Open Workshop (RoHOW)
will be held by team HULKs. This year, the RoHOW will be entirely virtual.
More information will be added soon on this website.

The RoHOW is an educational and networking event of the Hamburg University of
Technology (TUHH) with students and scientists from all over the world that are
active in research on humanoid robots.

Teams of the Standard Platform League are invited to present their work in
lectures, lightning talks or workshops. The RoHOW is organized by students from
the RoboCup team <a href="https://www.hulks.de/">HULKs</a> of the TUHH.
