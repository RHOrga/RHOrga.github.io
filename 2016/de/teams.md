## Participation Fees

Your participation will be free of charge, however accomodation and meals are not included (we will hopefully have some snacks free of charge).

## Rules

Please visit our leagues pages www.robocupgermanopen.de/major for a reference to the rules. Since the SPL will use 8mm artificial turf from next year on, there will be a single SPL standard sized field as seen in the RoboCup 2016 Outdoor Competition which will be shared with the Humanoid Kid Size Leage. If you have further questions or rules are missing please contact the chair of your league.
