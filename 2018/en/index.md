From 30th November to 2nd December 2018 the fifth Robotic Hamburg Open Workshop (RoHOW)
will be held at the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH).

The RoHOW is an educational and networking event of the Hamburg University of
Technology (TUHH) with students and scientists from all over the world that are
active in research on humanoid robots.

**Visitors** of all ages are cordially invited to get an impression of the latest
research in the field of robotics on December 3rd. Our sponsors 
will be giving talks on relevant topics in the industry. Members of the HULKs 
team will present the "Nao" robot and give an introduction to the Robocup research 
competition (child-friendly).

Children and teenagers from the age of 10 can look forward to the **robotics workshop** 
introduced last year. Here, robots can be built and programmed by the children 
themselves, giving them playful approach to the field of robotics.

Teams of the Standard Platform League are invited to present their work in
lectures, lightning talks or workshops. The RoHOW is organized by students from
the RoboCup team <a href="https://www.hulks.de/">HULKs</a> of the TUHH.
